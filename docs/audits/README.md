# Audits Index

This folder contains platform audits and execution notes. To avoid confusion, treat the files as follows:

- **Current source of truth (live execution log):**
  - `platform-audit-2026-02-07.md`

- **Historical / supporting audits (keep for reference):**
  - `platform-audit-2026-02-08-deep-dive.md` (deeper cross-cutting notes; many items were executed and reflected back into the 2026-02-07 audit and `docs/roadmap.md`)

If two files appear to repeat the same topic, prefer the most recent **Status Update** section in `platform-audit-2026-02-07.md`.
