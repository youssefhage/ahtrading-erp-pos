# Docs Index

## Start Here
- `workspace-guide.md`: where to edit and how folders are organized.
- `architecture.md`: main system architecture reference.
- `specs/api-map.md`: API surface overview.

## Key Sections
- `deploy/`: deployment and onboarding runbooks.
- `specs/`: API and domain specs.
- `audits/`: audit reports and findings.
- `pilot/`: pilot execution docs.
- `coa/`: chart-of-accounts references.

## Legacy Concept Notes
- `system-blueprint.md` and `system-map.md` are high-level concept summaries.
- Prefer `architecture.md` + `specs/*` for implementation and current behavior.
